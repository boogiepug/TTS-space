Hi! 
This repository contains my creative work that I use and via Tabletop Simulator. 

Tabletop Simulator is an engine used to simulate taobletop experience, which thrives on user generated and published content. 
Many objects i use in Tabletop Simulator (commonly knowns as TTS) are of my own creation, design, or simply edited by me. 
Despite generous cloud space provided by steam, I prefer github as storage for simplicity of uploading and content management,
which also means that things I would normally not publish anywhere has to be public. 
If you wish to use these creations in Tabletop Simulator, feel free to! For those who plan to download, edit, redistribute, please consider the fact that I do not have license to some of the artworks used in this repository. I do not give consent to selling any of my creations under any circumstances.

If you are a potential employer, please know that these are products of my free time and mostly for my own and my friends entertainment, not proffesional work.
